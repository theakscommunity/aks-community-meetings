## Code of Conduct

Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. 

This AKS Community is created for our customers and we want to ensure that every person and every organization has the opportunity to participate and benefit as much as possible. 

### What are the values this Community will embody?

**Be respectful and inclusive**

* Respect differences of opinion – just because someone holds a different viewpoint from your own, doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.
* Remember that people have varying communication styles different from your own.
* Show a willingness to understand more about the experiences of others.
* Ask questions to understand.

**Lead with empathy**
* Listen with purpose – seek to understand before being understood.
* Conduct yourself professionally and be kind to others.
* Show understanding for another person’s situation and emotions.

**Be friendly, open, and welcoming**
* Assume good intent and interpret others’ statements or questions in good faith.
* Promote a friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.
* Do not engage in or encourage any form of bullying, trolling, or threatening behavior. Report any concerns or incidents to the community moderators or administrators promptly.

**Be thoughtful**
* Think about how others will interpret your words – productive, clear communication requires effort.
* Use appropriate content and language: Avoid using offensive, explicit, or inappropriate content, including but not limited to profanity, discriminatory language, or offensive imagery. 
* Sometimes it is best to pause from commenting or reacting immediately to feedback/constructive criticism.
* We will make mistakes. When others are not at their best, we should reach out, offer support, and seek to understand. When you are at fault, listen, and ask how you can make things right.
