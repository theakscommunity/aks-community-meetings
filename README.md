## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Community

### What is the AKS Community? 

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Community is led by the AKS Product Team and is a place to connect with our customers and partners and share about the latest information for the platform. 

The Community connects with customers is 2 ways: 

1. [AKS YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@theakscommunity). This channel has all kinds of video content with the latest updates on AKS and Azure cloud native platforms. This includes:
    * Tech Updates and Demos
    * Mastering AKS content and learning series
    * "Code with me" style live streams
    * Recordings from events (eg - Azure Day from KubeCon events)

2. Monthly AKS Roadmap Community Meeting (Live). These monthly meetings will include: 
    * AKS Roadmap Update
    * Special topics and guest speakers
    * Live Q&A in the YouTube live stream
    * We will also include a corresponding Q&A in the [Azure Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/)

    The Community Meetings will be held on the **second Thursday of each month at 8:00am PST or 15:00 GMT.**
